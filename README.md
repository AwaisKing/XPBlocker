# Adblocker Reborn v2 (XPBlocker)

#### New maintainer by @AwaisKing
#### Old maintainer @HardcodedCat
#### Created by @aviraxp

## About
This is the recontinued reborn version of a deprecated Xposed module AdBlocker, relying on Xposed
Framework to work.
Why you should use it? Because it's not VPN or Hosts based! You can use any VPN you want while using
this Xposed Module for blocking all the ads in background. And also, you can choose which apps you
want to block, and their ad services and recievers. Deprecated but Handy, isn't it? :)

## Development
The original developer @aviraxp had abandoned this project since Nougat was coming.
Then, @zsakvo continued it a bit, and left.
Then, @HardcodedCat continued the project, i'm not sure if they still are.
Now, I (AWAiS) am continuing this project.
